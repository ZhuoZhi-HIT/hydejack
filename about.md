# Let me show you my hobbies

## Sports

"The root of life is movement", I am good at badminton, mountain bike downhill and swimming. Don't forget to exercise, no matter how busy you are.

## Music 

If you are interested in Post Rock, Metal, Symphony and Classical music, I believe we can sit in a coffee shop and chat all afternoon. As well I can play drum and guitar a little.

## Book

I always keep the habit of reading, which is an extension of the horizon and spirit for engineering students. I personally appreciate the works of Alexandre Dumas and David Stephen Mitchell, and I will try if you have a favorite author recommending it.

## Others

I have strong hands-on ability since I was a child, and am full of curiosity about novelty. I think this may be inherited by my father. I am interested in many mechanical and electronic equipment, such as: aircraft model (four-rotor, fixed wing), air gun (legal), car model, etc.
